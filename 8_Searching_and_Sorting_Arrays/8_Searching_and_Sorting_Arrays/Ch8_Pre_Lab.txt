1. The advantage of a linear search is that it is ________ .
2. The disadvantage of a linear search is that it is ________ .
3. The advantage of a binary search over a linear search is that a binary search is ________ .
4. An advantage of a linear search over a binary search is that the data must be ________ for a binary search.
5. After 3 passes of a binary search, approximately what fraction of the original array still needs to be searched (assuming the desired data has not been found)? ________ 
6. While the ________ sort algorithm is conceptually simple, it can be inefficient for large arrays because data values only move one at a time.
7. An advantage of the ________  sort is that, for an array of size n, at most n – 1 moves are required.
8. Use the bubble sort on the array below and construct the first 3 steps that actually make changes. (Assume the sort is from smallest to largest).
19		–4		91	0		–17
Element 0  Element1  Element 2  Element 3 Element 4
Element 0  Element1 Element 2 Element 3 Element 4
Element 0 Element 1 Element 2 Element 3 Element 4
Element 0 Element 1 Element 2 Element 3 Element 4
